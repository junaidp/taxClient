This relief covers the like-for-like replacement of items, but not the initial purchase or any upgrades beyond a similar standard. The initial cost of furnishing or major upgrades is considered a capital expense, these costs are typically accounted for when calculating Capital Gains Tax (CGT) upon the property's sale, provided they enhance the property's value or extend its useful life.",
